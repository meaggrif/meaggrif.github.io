## Welcome to My GitHub Page

I am an [Information Science major](https://ischool.umd.edu/infosci) at the University of Maryland.

Outside of Information Science, I enjoy doing research in [linguistics](http://ling.umd.edu/), which I am pursuing as a minor.

### Data Science & Linguistic Projects

Below are some projects I have been working on with regards to my fields of study.

```markdown

# Technica - [Causal Analytics for Smart Manufacturing] (https://devpost.com/software/causality-analytics-for-smart-manufacturing?flow%5Bdata%5D%5Binvitation_key%5D=9Z1FJdp_12fGsvyKYm_Q&flow%5Bname%5D=accept_software_invitation&ref_content=new_user_added_to_software_team&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=email&utm_campaign=software&utm_content=invitation_to_join_software_team&utm_medium=email&utm_source=transactional)

- As a participant in the Tech + Research Workshop at the 2018 Technica Women's Hackathon, I conducted data analysis using the VAR library in Python and Granger Causality method.
- My team and I determined how to find causal relationships between variables in time series data sets.

# Critical Period Horomone Research

- I am currently creating a proposal for a linguistic study regarding the novel theory regarding a critcal period for language.
- Essentially, the study will be examining whether or not, assuming the critical period theory is true, the timing of the critical period occuring before/at the onset is related to hormones.
- The research would include experiments with subjects undergoing T-therapy and those who are not to see if there is a difference in performance in acquisition tasks that those outside of the critical period seem to fail.

### Other Interests

Outside of academia, one of my passions is music. I am the Community Outreach and Media Director for the Terrapin Record Label, as well as a signed artist! I recently released an EP and play shows frequently at MilkBoy Arthouse.
