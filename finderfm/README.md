# Title: FinderFM
## Description:
This was a group project completed in Fall 2019. It is a website that helps users filter, find, and attend PG County farmers markets. My role included developing a Node.js Express server and JavaScript functions on the front end to enable filtering on the market search page. Others on the team focused on the styling and content for the website.
