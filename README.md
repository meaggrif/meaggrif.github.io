# What are these websites?

I developed these web for ongoing research that I am conducting with the Trace Center at University of Maryland. 
We are investigating the time lost by blind users when they encounter accessibility barriers on the web. These sites 
were developed to be accessible by the WCAG 2.0 AA standards, or to include accessibility barriers in direct violation
WCAG 2.0 AA standards. 

# How were they developed?

In order to streamline the development process, I utilized the Twitter Boostrap Modern Business template. Bootstrap templates
are also fairly accessible so it provided a good base for the sites that needed to be WCAG compliant. I used basic HTML and 
JavaScript to edit and customize the template. I also used ARIA labels to fix or break the accessibility within the website.
